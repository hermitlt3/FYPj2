Ok the story I thought of is actually abit dark and "sort of" aid us
in the fact that we don't have to find sprites for the protagonist.

His name is Nel (means Null), and the story is that he arrived to this
"world" called Namelos (means Nameless) without knowing why. And he 
doesn't have a physical body and is just an unknown scribble. So he 
sets off to find the reason why he was sent here. Then as he progresses,
he realises that he can never physically die but can experience the 
taste of death over and over. 

Soon he got more depressed as he progresses the level, knowing when his
journey will end since death isn't a way out. But he finds out that to
escape this world, he needs to know who he is. At the final area, he 
fights this Grim Reaper-like boss and upon defeating him, finds out that
it is actually him (same conscious), and that they are both
on the brink of death in reality. He finds out that before he lands in
this world, he was having severe depression from all the failures he
had in his life. And he plans on suicide by taking plenty of sleeping
pills. This world was created the moment before he loses consciousness.
Since he defeated his apparent "curse", he was given a choice
between:
- having another chance in life; or 
- to risk being stuck in a void(no pun intended) as his world slowly destroys

???what happens next? its for you to decide >:)???
